# Framework

The core framework for our projects ;)

For devs that want to modify the frontend using tailwind css make sure you build the frontend first :)

```bash
# Clean old css and build new css
npm run clean && npm run build
# Or if you just want to live compile (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)
npm run watch
```
