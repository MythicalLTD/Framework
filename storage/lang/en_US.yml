# MythicalFramework

# This is the default language file for the MythicalFramework. You can add your own language files in the 'lang' directory.
# You can also use some prefixes that will get processed by the framework.

# Prefixes:
# %app_name% - The name of the application
# %app_url% - The URL of the application
# %app_timezone% - The timezone of the application
# %app_logo% - The logo of the application
# %seo_title% - The SEO title of the application
# %seo_description% - The SEO description of the application
# %seo_keywords% - The SEO keywords of the application

# If you were asking what raw input means here is a simple explanation:
# Raw input means that the input is not processed by the framework. This means that the input is not escaped or sanitized.
# This is useful for passwords or other sensitive data that should not be processed by the framework.

# The language file is divided into sections. Each section has its own keys and values.
# You can use the keys in your views to display the values in the correct language.
