This function does not perform any input validation so please always make sure you perform
input validation like if the email is right or the password is a strong one and so on!

There are anti SQL injection methods what so ever!

When using this function you can either get the user token: `mythicalframework_` in this format of the begging or you may get and error!
Every error starts with an `ERROR_` incase something fails!

Here are a list of errors that you may get!

- `ERROR_USERNAME_EXISTS` This means that the username was found in the database already
